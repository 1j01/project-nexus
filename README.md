# Project Nexus

A hub for all your programming projects.


Do you find yourself opening and closing lots of
* project folders
* git clients
* terminals / shitty command windows
* and code editors?

Maybe you don't need to *close* all of these things,
but there are still many repetitive steps involved in switching projects.

Do you find yourself switching to your terminal
or shitty outdated command window
and hitting
<kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> +
<kbd>Ë„</kbd> +
<kbd>Enter</kbd>
to restart?

No more!
Well, once I make this thing that is.
So far I've got a list of projects,
where each project containing a `package.json` file
has an [`npm start` / `npm stop` / kill process] button.
