# Project Nexus

A hub for all your programming projects.


Do you find yourself opening and closing lots of
* project folders
* git clients
* terminals / shitty command windows
* and code editors?

Maybe you don't need to close all of these things exactly,
but there are still many repetitive steps involved in switching projects.

Do you find yourself switching to your terminal or shitty command window and hitting
<kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> +
<kbd>Ë„</kbd> +
<kbd>Enter</kbd>?

No more!
